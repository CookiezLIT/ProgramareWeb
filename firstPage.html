				<h2>Chelsea-Everton Match preview 08.03.2021</h2>
				<p>On Monday, when fourth-placed Chelsea take on Everton, fifth at the start of the weekend, it will be a year ago to the day that a full Stamford Bridge cheered the hosts to a 4-0 victory in the same fixture.</p>
				<p>The Blues have returned from the last two away trips with potentially crucial victories that would have lived long in the memory of all those present in different times. Now comes another Premier League six-pointer on home ground, still behind closed doors.</p>
				<p>The Londoners have won 10 of the past 14 top-flight fixtures played on Mondays and so far this campaign are unbeaten in four matches played on this day of the week.</p>

				<h2>Chelsea-Liverpool 1:0</h2>
				<p>Liverpool defender Andy Robertson says they cannot "rely on the past" after Chelsea inflicted a fifth successive competitive home defeat on the reigning Premier League champions for the first time in their history to leave them battling to make the top four.</p>
				<p>Mason Mount's superb individual strike three minutes before half-time gave the visitors a deserved win and extend their unbeaten run under boss Thomas Tuchel to 10 games.

It moved them into the top four, while Liverpool are now in seventh place and in a serious dogfight for the Champions League places</p>

					<h3><i>How Tuchel changed Chelsea</i></h3>
					<p>It’s not just the consistency Tuchel has instilled in his new team in a very short space of time, it’s the opposition they have faced over this 10-match stretch. It’s not as if the former Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain has had an easy start to life in England having faced Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in his first month.</p>
